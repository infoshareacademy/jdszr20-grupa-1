U.N. judges had ordered a five-minute bathroom break for Mladic, 74, before issuing their verdict in his trial for 11 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity including genocide. That pause then stretched on for more than an hour.   They took his blood pressure during the break. We don t know the readings, but they said they could continue with the verdict. We are very concerned about his blood pressure because he has already has four strokes,  Darko Mladic said. \n",

The two fighters were able to establish communication with the aircraft. This incident occured at about 7 p.m. ET. No further details were immediately available. The intent of military intercepts is to have the identified aircraft re-establish communications with local FAA air traffic controllers and instruct the pilot to follow air traffic controllers instructions to land safely for follow-on action, the statement read.Earlier this month, a private plane got within 2 nautical miles of Air Force One, which is closer than permitted, while flying over Florida and the incident is being investigated by authorities, Bloomberg reported.

The report did not name those involved in what appeared to be the first large-scale release since the royals, business people and government officials were detained in a crackdown spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The suspects have been held at Riyadh s luxurious Ritz Carlton hotel since early November and told to hand over assets and cash in exchange for their freedom. Okaz said more detainees would be released in the coming days and trial proceedings would begin soon for those who continue to deny the charges against them.

Burr told reporters earlier on Thursday that Flynn’s lawyers had said he would not honor the subpoena issued in connection with the committee’s investigation into Russia and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Congressional aides told Reuters the committee was still negotiating in the hopes of obtaining the requested documents. “Consistent with the committee’s position since the beginning of (our) investigation, I welcome their willingness to cooperate,” Burr said in his two-sentence statement.\n",

      "- Hilarious: What “Small Talk” Among Friends Looks Like at The Moment Pinterest Robert Gehl reports that Newt Gingrich has accused Fox News’ Megyn Kelly of being “fascinated” by sex, and not caring at all about public policy in a shocking and startling interview. The former Speaker of the House said Kelly showed “bias” for mentioning the groping allegations against Donald Trump. Kelly responded by saying her fascination is not of “sex,” but of who was going to end up in the White House. Kelly has a history with Trump – getting into a shouting match with the Republican candidate over comments he made about women during a primary debate. What set Gingrich off was Kelly’s mention of the leaked “sex boasts” tapes, where Trump is heard to say he grabs women by the genitals. Gingrich attacked, saying the media was obsessed with spending time on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied. “You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy,” he said. “I’m not fascinated by sex, but I’m fascinated about sexual predators,” Kelly said. The bias the media has against Trump – especially focusing on sex – is historic. “This is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia, ” Gingrich said. Take a look at the awesome video:\n",

      "- WIKILEAKS Re-Directs Focus On Bill Clinton- It’s NOT Pretty Just days before the it’s time to vote our next President into the White House, the Clinton family get bad news, after bad news, after bad news. Now..guess what is happening? MORE bad news! However, bad news for the Clintons means good news for us. We all knew that Hillary was a scheming snake of corruption who loves nothing but power and money. However with each new hit that came her way in October, many of us were still shocked over the sheer madness of it all. Now, Wikileaks is giving Bill Clinton some time under the microscope of truth. Via The Daily Caller : Ira Magaziner, the CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, asked former President Bill Clinton to thank Morocco’s King Mohammed VI for “offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia.” “CHAI would like to request that President Clinton call Sheik Mohammed to thank him for offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia,” Magaziner gushed in a November 22, 2011 email released by WikiLeaks. Clinton frequently has expected free, luxurious private jet travel during his post-presidential life. Clinton, his wife and daughter have artfully secured free air travel and luxurious accommodations since they left the White House. It’s an effective way to accept gifts of great value without declaring them for the Clinton Foundation. “It’s highly illegal and it’s likely that the owners of these aircraft took tax deductions as a gift to the Clinton Foundation,” Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and critic of the Clinton Foundation, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Of course! Classic Clinton crap… living the life of luxury on the backs of hardworking Americans. That’s what they do! Related Items\n",

      "- Saudi Arabia releases corruption detainees, others to stand trial: report   - Saudi Arabia has released 23 of the 200-or-so powerful individuals detained since November on corruption charges after they reached deals with the government, Okaz newspaper reported on Tuesday. The report did not name those involved in what appeared to be the first large-scale release since the royals, business people and government officials were detained in a crackdown spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The suspects have been held at Riyadh s luxurious Ritz Carlton hotel since early November and told to hand over assets and cash in exchange for their freedom. Okaz said more detainees would be released in the coming days and trial proceedings would begin soon for those who continue to deny the charges against them. Saudi authorities see the settlements not as blackmail but as an obligation to reimburse money taken illegally from the world s top oil producer over several decades. Video posted on social media showed a smiling Saoud al-Daweesh, the former chief executive of Saudi Telecom, telling well-wishers he had been treated decently. Private Affairs (a unit of the Royal Court) brought us a full lamb dish day and night. They treated us well and did a good job, he said. Saudi officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "- Trump ex-adviser Flynn yet to indicate whether he will honor subpoena: senator   - Lawyers for President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn have not yet indicated whether Flynn plans to comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s subpoena for documents, the panel’s chairman said in a statement on Thursday. “General Flynn’s attorneys have not yet indicated their intentions regarding the Senate Intelligence Committee’s subpoena,” Republican Senator Richard Burr said in a statement. Burr told reporters earlier on Thursday that Flynn’s lawyers had said he would not honor the subpoena issued in connection with the committee’s investigation into Russia and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Congressional aides told  the committee was still negotiating in the hopes of obtaining the requested documents. “Consistent with the committee’s position since the beginning of (our) investigation, I welcome their willingness to cooperate,” Burr said in his two-sentence statement.\n",
